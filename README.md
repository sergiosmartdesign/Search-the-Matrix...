# The Matrix - Animated Search Page

This Progect was created using only Vibe Coding.

A fully immersive, single-page web application inspired by the iconic visual style of *The Matrix*. This project is a standalone HTML file that uses pure CSS and JavaScript to create an animated, themed search experience. No external libraries or dependencies are required.


## ‚ú® Features

- **Digital Rain Background:** A dynamic, full-screen "digital rain" effect created with JavaScript on an HTML Canvas, which resizes with the window.
- **Immersive Animation Sequence:** A carefully timed animation that reveals the search bar, an SVG icon of Morpheus, and types out a famous dialogue in the placeholder.
- **Interactive Search Bar:** The search bar is fully functional and submits queries to Google in a new tab.
- **CSS Glitch Effect:** After the introductory text, the Morpheus icon disappears with a custom "shake and fade" glitch animation created with CSS keyframes.
- **Animated SVG Favicon:** A custom, animated SVG favicon is embedded directly into the HTML for a complete, portable experience.
- **Self-Contained:** Everything is packed into a single HTML file. No build process, no dependencies, just open and run.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout includes a media query to adjust the search bar's width on smaller screens.
